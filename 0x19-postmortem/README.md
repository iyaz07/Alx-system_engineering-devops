Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred from April 13, 2024, at 10:00 PM (UTC) to April 14, 2024, at 2:00 AM (UTC), lasting 4 hours.

Impact: The primary impact was on the web service, resulting in complete unavailability for all users during the outage period. User experience was severely impacted, with 100% of users unable to access the service.

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, causing it to incorrectly route traffic away from the web servers.

Timeline:

10:00 PM (UTC): Issue detected as monitoring alerts indicated a sudden drop in incoming traffic to the web service.

10:15 PM (UTC): Investigation initiated, focusing on the web server logs and network configurations.

11:30 PM (UTC): Initial assumption made that the issue might be related to network congestion or a DDoS attack due to the sudden drop in traffic.

12:30 AM (UTC): Further investigation revealed misconfigurations in the load balancer settings, leading to incorrect routing of traffic.

1:00 AM (UTC): Incident escalated to the network operations team for immediate resolution.

2:00 AM (UTC): Issue resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer to correctly route traffic to the web servers.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, specifically in the routing rules, causing it to divert incoming traffic away from the web servers. This misconfiguration was likely introduced during recent updates to the load balancer configuration.

To resolve the issue, the load balancer settings were carefully reviewed, and the incorrect routing rules were identified and corrected. Once the configuration changes were applied, traffic began flowing correctly to the web servers, restoring service availability for users.
